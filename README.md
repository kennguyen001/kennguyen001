# Ken Nguyen 👋

I’m Ken Nguyen, onchain data analyst and blockchain commentator. I dive deep into crypto data, airdrop farming strategies, and market trends, then share insights with a healthy dose of skepticism and slight sarcasm.

## About Me

I explore, answer, and visualize intriguing crypto questions by mining onchain and offchain data. My analyses center on:

- Airdrop farming and evaluation heuristics  
- Remittance fee comparisons across crypto, stablecoins, and traditional services  
- Market manipulation tactics and token-sale timing  

---

## 🔭 Current Projects

- Analyzing remittance fees between rails: crypto vs. stablecoins vs. legacy services  
- Building an airdrop-evaluation toolkit to score projects by risk, community hype, and reward potential  
- Publishing periodic reports on token-sale strategies and market-cycle timing  

---

## 🌱 Currently Learning

- Integrating AI into my data workflows for faster ETL, visualization, and anomaly detection  
- Advanced Python libraries for blockchain data (e.g., Polars, Apache Arrow)  
- Machine-learning models to forecast onchain event outcomes  

---

## 💡 Skills & Expertise

- Onchain data analytics (Etherscan, Nansen, OpenBlock)  
- Interactive visualizations (Plotly, D3.js, Tableau)  
- Statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and time-series modeling  
- Critical research: assessing project transparency, tokenomics, and community dynamics
